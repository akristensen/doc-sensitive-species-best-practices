== Acknowledgements

The earlier document (https://doi.org/10.15468/doc-b02j-gt10[Chapman and Grafton 2008]) acknowledged the many people who responded to the initial survey and who attended the workshops and who were valuable in the preparation of that document. 

In addition, I would now like to thank John Wieczorek and Paula Zermoglio, for the on-going support and advice, as well as staff at the GBIF Secretariat, especially Laura Russell and Kyle Copas who oversaw the project.
